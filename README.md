# LeaveEngineRunning

**LeaveEngineRunning** is a modern FiveM resource that lets players leave their vehicle engine running when exiting. It features full networked engine and lights states, optimised performance, and localisation support.

## Key Features

- **Networked Engine & Lights:** All players see engine and light states in real time.  
- **Optimised Performance:** Idle threads minimise CPU/resmon impact.  
- **One-Time Notification:** Localised message appears once per session.  
- **Auto Light-Off:** Turns off lights when leaving vehicle without leaving engine running.  
- **Configurable Options:** Emergency restriction, door open, high beams, debug mode.  
- **Localisation Support:** `en.lua`, `fr.lua`, easy to add more languages.  
- **Original Behaviour Preserved:** Hold `F` to leave engine running.
